## Overview

### The Challenge 
Through this project, I aimed to recreate an HTML page based on the project image. For this initial project, I chose not to create responsive code.

## My process

### Build with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this project, I have learned the fundamentals of CSS, gained a better understanding of grid and flexbox, but I believe there's room for improvement in my HTML code, although I'm not quite sure how to go about it.

### Continued development

I would like to enhance my efficiency for small projects like this one, and, of course, incorporate interactive features for user engagement while implementing responsive design.
